# What is the Ultramarine Game Protocol?

It is a Game Protocol with which any user will create his decentralized games based on cryptographically secure randomness.
The user does not need to have deep knowledge in blockchain development, because the game creation and configuration can be done in the interface of the web application.

#### The categories of users who will interact with Ultramarine can be divided into:

- Game creators - these are the users who will create games, add liquidity to them and run advertising campaigns to attract players;
- Players are the users who will interact with Ultramarine through the web application interface.
- Developers are the users who will create their own interesting solutions for Ultramarine, exchange data in Web3 between smart contracts or in Web2 via the Ultramarine subgraph in TheGraph Protocol.

#### At this stage of development, the Ultramarine Game Protocol has these features:

- To create a new game, you need to come up with its name, background color, and emoji for two NFT cards (there is no limit to the number of cards in a smart contract);
- At each draw, an NFT is minted with the card the player bet on;
- The NFT token is stored on-chain and is generated on the fly with the game result metadata;
- The liquidity in the game is added by the creator and the maximum bet is calculated based on it (by default it is 10-th part of the liquidity).
- Winnings are credited to the player's Intra-game balance in a smart contract and can be withdrawn at any time;
- Chainlink VRF is responsible for cryptographically secure randomness;
- With Push Protocol, it is possible to receive notifications from the smart contract about the state of liquidity in the game;
- The Ultramarine subgraph in TheGraph Protocol indexes new game data;
- Smart contracts are deployed in Polygon and Filecoin test networks.
